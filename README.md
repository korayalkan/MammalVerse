# **MammalVerse: Exploring the Diversity of Mammals through Deep Learning**

Welcome to MammalMinds, an exciting journey into the world of mammals powered by state-of-the-art deep learning and image processing. In this repository, we have developed a mammal classification model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify and categorize 45 different mammal species.
<br>
Our dataset consists of a total of 13,751 high-resolution (256x256 pixels) JPG images, providing a comprehensive view of the mammalian kingdom.

## Project Overview
Our mission is to create an intelligent system capable of precisely classifying mammals based on visual characteristics captured in images. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and image processing, our model has been trained to discern distinctive features of each mammal species.
<br>
The dataset encompasses a wide array of mammals, allowing the model to learn and differentiate among the rich diversity present in the animal kingdom.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-Learn
- Deep Learning
- Image Processing

## Access the Dataset
To explore and utilize the dataset employed in this project, visit the [Mammals Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/mammals-image-classification-dataset-45-animals). Follow the dataset's page for download and usage instructions.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into 45 classes, each representing a unique mammal species. The images are categorized as follows:
- class1/: African Elephant
- class2/: Alpaca
- ...
- class45/: Zebra

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repo_url]`
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory: `cd MammalMinds`
3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.
